# DevTKSS Uno Mvux Samples Gallery App

Example project which should show how different mvux ui controls and model binding can be done

## Current state

- [x] Created a [first `working` state](https://github.com/DevTKSS/UnoHotDesignApp1/commit/9f6479fa37901a0478bbc9e1c3e92221223ce4d0)

  Not acceptable for me as final result since it had very poor performance and not relyable functionality

- [ ] Restructuring, Refactoring applying SOC
- [-] Implement SampleCode Presenting like Gallery to have the src code side by side in the running app
  - [x] [Working State of DashboardPage](https://github.com/DevTKSS/UnoHotDesignApp1/commit/98fa25af8f23bb27c2dccac39d9248f3fc7254dd)
- [ ] (Re)record the video to show a final step by step Guide to Beginners like me and simplify the start with uno.extensions with Mvux.

## Controls to be explored in this App

- FeedView + GridView
- FeedView + ListView
- DataTemplate centralized Recource definition
- Card
- "ItemOverlayTemplate" DataTemplate layout replicated from WinUI 3 Gallery

## Uno.Extensions to be explored here

- Storage
- Serialization
- Localization
- Configuration
- Mvux
- Navigation 
- Hosting

## Fist Recording (uncut, without sound)
