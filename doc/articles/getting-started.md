# Getting Started

To setup your Development Environment for Uno Apps, please make sure, to follow the [Quick Start Guide](https://platform.uno/docs/articles/get-started.html) provided by Uno Platform which will include:

- Download latest dotnet
- Install your desired IDE

  > [!NOTE]
  > I will use Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition for the Guides described in here.

- Get the Uno Extension from the Visual Studio Marketplace
- Install Uno.Check via your Commandline: `dotnet tool install -g Uno.Check`
- Run `uno-check` which will suggest you to get or fix missing Workloads for you, to ensure a smooth start unto development every day.

  > [!NOTE]
  > There are configurations available to be applied onto the uno-check command. You can research them in the [Uno.Check Documentation](https://platform.uno/docs/articles/external/uno.check/doc/configuring-uno-check.html) or get them in your Commandline by typing `uno-check -h`

- In case, you run in Problems while this, make sure to check out the [Troubleshooting](https://platform.uno/docs/articles/external/uno.check/doc/troubleshooting-uno-check.html)

All done? Great!

I recommend you to do at least the [Counter Workshop](https://platform.uno/docs/articles/getting-started/counterapp/get-started-counter.html) to get a base understanding of:

- Application Structure
- Assets (Images/Icons) handling with Uno.Resizetizer
- Commands and Bindings

  > [!TIP]
  > Depending on the targeted Tutorial you would like to do in here, you should coose the appropriate kind of the workshop, as it is letting you choose between XAML or C# for Markup and MVVM or MVUX as Presentation / Application Structure.

See you soon in the mested Tutorials here!
